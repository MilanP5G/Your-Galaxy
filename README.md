This is a React + Redux application called Your Galaxy that allows you to add your Samsung Galaxy devices - along with their pros and cons - and report any hardware and/or software defects.

## Installation
Fork and clone this repo. In the terminal, cd into the api/server side ```cd your_galaxy_api``` and then run ```rails s```. Next, you will need to open another terminal and cd into the client side ```cd your_galaxy_client``` and then run ```npm start```.

## Usage
You can add a Samsung Galaxy device that you own by clicking on 'Your Devices' (top right) in the navbar. Once there, click on the plus button/card to add the device with its model name, uploading an image, and its pros and cons. When you submit the device, it will create a device card on the 'Your Device' page. In order to go into a device and view its pros and cons, simply click the name of the device which is in blue.
In order to report a defect with your device's', click on 'Report' in the navbar and you can create a new report post clicking the add button/card. You will be able to add a title and description about the issue. Once submitted, this will create a report box/card showing the title and the description. To view the report and leave comments on this report, click on the title of the report.
To delete a device and a report, simply click 'delete' on the bottom of a device card and 'resolved' on the bottom of a report box.
